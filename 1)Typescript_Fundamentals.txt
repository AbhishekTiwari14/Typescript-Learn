L1: BASIC SETUP
Typescript is a 'strongly typed' language built on top of JS, which provides us with 'type safety' and hence makes the project less error-prone & more scalabe.

-> npm i typescript -g: Install typescript package

-> in terminal, "tsc ts_fileName.ts js_fileName.js"(not neccessary if same file name) will compile our typescript file into javascript file.
    -> "tsc ts_fileName.ts -w" will watch continously and recompile the ts file whenever any change in it is made
    -> "tsc -w" will watch for all ts files
-> "tsc --init" will initialize a ts config file

-> in config file, 
set "rootDir: ./src"(folder in which .ts files are), 
& "outDir: ./build/js"(folder in which we want compile .js files to be stored)

-> at the end of config file,
},
  "include": ["src"]
will make sure that all ts files outside src folders will be ignored(not be compiled)

-> in config file, 
"noEmitOnError": true,
will not compile ts->js if ts file throws error and won't compile into js file(ex. 6/'3' is an error in ts)
OR 
we can do "tsc --noEmitOnError -w" in terminal for temporarily enabling it

-> TS is strongly typed: need to explicitly declare type(JS is loosly typed) & it is also 
statically typed: types are checked at compile time (JS is dynamically typed: types checked at runtime) 

-> explicit type declaration: 
let a: number = 5;
let b: string = '10'
....................................................

L2: BASIC TYPES:
-> TS infers(implicitly detects) data type: ex. let a = 'Hello', TS will infer that a is a string, but we can explicitly declare DT as let a : string = 'Hello'

-> //basic TS types:
//number, string, boolean, any, union, RegExp, never

.....................................................

L3: ARRAYS, TUPLES, OBJECTS, ENUMS
-> Arrays: Type is assigned to array & not the individual element
    -> Ex. const b: (number | string)[] = ['av', 'asfa', 24];
    b.push('daf'); b[1] = 12; etc. can be done but b.push(true) will throw error
    -> another syntax: 

-> Tuples: Type is assigned to each element of array
    -> Ex. myTuple : [number, string, boolean] = [12, 'bca', false] 
    myTuple[0] = 24, myTuple[2] = true can be done but myTuple[0] = 'ga' will throw error
    myTuple = myArray will give error(even if DTs remain same) as array may or may not have same DT at same index as tuple.

-> Objects: Type is defined to individual prop value
    -> Ex. let myobj = { name: 'faa', age: 12}; myobj.age = 'asd' will give error;
-> Type-Defining an object (defining an object class): 
    -> M1: type Animals = {type: string, life: number, region?: string}  
    //note: optional prop pe method apply karne pe error ayega(bcoz it maybe undefined), so use optional chaining
    let myObj2 : Animals = {type: 'lizard', life: 10, region: 'antarctica'} 
    -> M2: interface Humans { name: string, age: number}
    //Note: M1 & M2 work the same way for objects, however, tupe aliases can be made for other DTs but interface works only for objects(note: it works for array & fxn. as well bcoz they are also objects)
    let user : Humans = {name: 'afa', age: 23} 
    
    ->// function with defined object as parameter
    const greetHuman = (insaan: Humans) => {
        console.log(`Hi! ${insaan.name}`);
    }
    greetHuman(user); //`Hi! afa`

-> Enums: just as Serial nos.; not a type-addition, but feature addition on runtime
enum Grade{
    A = 8, //by-default = 0
    E,      // A+1 = 9
    I,      // A+2  = 10
    O,     // A+3 = 11 
    U      // A+4 = 12
}

console.log(Grade.A, Grade.E, Grade.I); // 8 9 10

-> Type Aliases: 
type stringOrNum = string | number
let score: stringOrNum; //smae as let score: string|number

-> Literal Types: assigning value(s) and not type(s)
let userName: 'John' | 'Jonatthen' | 'Trott'
userName = 'Aman' //error
userName = 'Trott' //no error
............................................................

L4: FUNCTIONS
-> let sum = (a: number, b: number): void => {  //void => fxn. not return anything 
    console.log(a+b);  
} 

-> //Defining fxn. type(fxn. class)
type mathFxn = (a: number, b: number) => number
//same as 
// interface matFxn {
//    (a: number, b: number) : number
//}

let multiply : mathFxn = function(c, d) {
    return c*d;
}

-> Rest parameters
const sumAll = (a: number, b: number, ...nums: number[]) : number => {
    return nums.reduce((acc, curr) =>  acc+curr);
}
log(sumAll(1,2,3,4,5)); //ans = 15, a = 1, b = 2, nums = [3,4,5] 
//note: rest paras are defined at last 

//'never' TS type: special cases, ex1) function explicitly returning error, ex2) infinite loop in a function => TS infers return type as 'never' 

...........................................................

L5: TYPE ASSERTION or TYPE CASTING
type one = string;
type two = number | string;
type three = 'hello';

//convert to more or less specefic
let a : one = 'hello';
let b = a as two; //less specefic: b can be a number or string (currently, b = 'hello')
b = 24;
let c =a as three; //more specefic

const addOrConcat = (a: number, b: number, c: 'add' | 'concat') : string|number => {
    if(c === 'add') return a+b;
    return '' + a + b;
}

let ans: string = addOrConcat(2,9,'concat'); //error bcoz fxn. may return number or string (as inferred by TS) but here we have explicitly give ans type = string, so to overrule TS and typecast ans, we can use 'as'

let jawab: string = addOrConcat(2,9,'concat') as string; //no error
//do so only if you are sure of type of the variable typecasted
let val: string = addOrConcat(2,9,'concat') as number; //error

//double casting or force casting : to avoid TS error, first convert to type unknown(similar to any but can be used only for this purpose)
10 as string ; //gives error
(10 as unknown) as string; //no error //force casting
 
//DOM
const img = document.getElementById('myImg')!;// explicitly telling that img is not null
const img = document.getElementById('myImg') as HTMLImageElement;  //explicitly telling TS that I know that this element exists 

...............................................................

L6: CLASSES
class coder{
    constructor(public name: string, public age: number, public lang: string){ 
        //we can use private,protected or readonly instead of public as well
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.lang = lang;
    }
}
const Ab = new coder("Abhishek", 22, "Typescript");

class webDev extends coder{  //wbDev is a sub-class of coder class
    constructor(public name: string, public age: number, public lang: string){
        super(name, age, lang);   //we mention every property we get with coder class in super
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.lang = lang;
    }
    
}

-> implementing class using an interface
interface Cricketer{
    name: string,
    type: string,

    pace(speed: number): string ; 
}

class Bowler implements Cricketer{
    name: string
    type: string
    constructor(name: string, type: string){
        this.name = name,
        this.type = type,
    }
    pace(speed: string){
        console.log(`${this.name} bowls at ${speed} KMPH`);
    }
}
const anderson = new Bowler(""Jimmy", "bowler");
anderson.pace(146); //Jimmy bowls at 146 KMPH 

-> static var in a class belongs to the class and not any instance of that class 
...........................................................

L7: INDEX SIGNATURES & KEYOF ASSERTIONS

-> Index Signature helps access val of a key/prop in an object 'dynamically'; obj1[key1] or obj1.key1 gives val1 but if we do let prop1 = 'key1' & obj1[prop1], then it will give error. another x. is when looping through elements : for (const key in obj1) -> it will again give error.

-> Solution 1: Declare Index Signature for the props when creating a class or interface; ex: 
    interface obj2{
        [key: string]: number | string; //all keys of obj2=>strings & values can be number or string
    }
    const student = {
        name: "abhi",
        marks: 30
    }
    now, let prop1 = 'name' -> obj2[prop1] will give val1(ie, abhi) & not throw error.

->  Solution 2[Without using Index Sign]: 'key as keyof typeof obj1' will do union  with all keys of    obj1 and won't throw error. ex. Object.Keys(obj1).map(key-> clog(key as keyof typeof obj1) )
